This simple utility helps DOTNET developers -who usually write sql statements inside the C# code as strings that are prone to syntax errors- to write sql keywords as C# methods that generate the sql statements behind the scenes.
Simply it makes a little bit of functionality that is similar to what Linq-To-SQl does.
But with this utility you can do a little more work than what LTS does.
The most important aspect of its functionality is that you can control the generated SQL code.
